# Ribbit

A small, portable and extensible Scheme implementation that supports closures, tail calls, first-class continuations, a REPL and AOT and incremental compilers. All that for a run time footprint around 4 KB!

Ribbit currently supports 9 targets such as *JavaScript*, *Assembly (x86)*, *C*, *Python* and *POSIX Shell*, with more to come !

For more information about Ribbit, you can look at our papers in the [paper section](#research-and-papers) or check out [all supported targets](#supported-targets)

## Try it now !

You can [try the REPL with a minimal library here](https://udem-dlteam.github.io/ribbit/repl-min.html) or [try a more featureful version here](https://udem-dlteam.github.io/ribbit/repl-max.html).

Please note that currently the incremental compiler used by the REPL only supports a subset of the Scheme special forms. In particular procedure definitions should use the syntax `(define name (lambda ...))` . The AOT compiler supports more features including the forms `quote`, `lambda`, `define`, `set!`, `if`, `cond`, `and`, `or`, `begin`, `let`, `let*`, `letrec`, and named `let`.

### Usage

The Ribbit AOT compiler is written in Scheme and can be executed with Gambit, Guile, Chicken and Kawa. It has been tested with Gambit v4.7.5 and above. For the best experience install Gambit from https://github.com/gambit/gambit .

There are also prebuilt versions of the Ribbit AOT compiler in the `prebuilt` directory, allowing the AOT compiler to be executed using another language interpreter, such as nodejs, CPython, and even just a POSIX shell.

The AOT compiler's source code is in a single file: `src/rsc.scm` . This Scheme file can be executed as a program with the Gambit, Guile, Chicken or Kawa interpreters. Alternatively the AOT compiler can be executed using the `src/rsc` shell script, which has the additional `-c` option to select a specific build of the Ribbit AOT compiler which is useful for bootstrapping Ribbit or to execute one of the prebuilt versions.

Ribbit currently supports the target languages C, JavaScript, Python, Scheme, Haskell, Lua, Assembly (x86), Ocaml and POSIX shell which are selectable with the compiler's `-t` option with `c`, `js`, `py`, `scm`, `hs`, `lua`, `asm`, `ml`, and `sh` respectively.  The compacted RVM code can be obtained with the target `rvm` which is the default.

The `-m` option causes a minification of the generated program. This requires a recent version of Gambit.

The `-l` option allows selecting the Scheme runtime library (located in the `lib` subdirectory). The `min` library has the fewest procedures and a REPL that supports the core Scheme forms only. The `max` library has most of the R4RS predefined procedures, except for file I/O. The `max-tc` library is like `max` but with run time type checking. The default is the `max-tc` library.

Here are a few examples (all assume that a `cd src` has been done first):

    Use the Gambit interpreter to compile the minimal REPL to Python
    and execute with python3:

      $ ./rsc -t py -l min repl-min.scm
      $ echo "(define f (lambda (n) (if (< n 2) n (+ (f (- n 1)) (f (- n 2))))))(f 25)" | python3 repl-min.scm.py
      > 0
      > 75025
      >

    Alternatively one of the prebuilt versions can be used to achieve the
    same result:

      $ ./rsc -t py -l min -c "node prebuilt/rsc.js"       repl-min.scm
      $ ./rsc -t py -l min -c "python3 prebuilt/rsc.py"    repl-min.scm
      $ ./rsc -t py -l min -c "runhaskell prebuilt/rsc.hs" repl-min.scm
      $ ./rsc -t py -l min -c "lua prebuilt/rsc.lua"       repl-min.scm
      $ ./rsc -t py -l min -c "scala prebuilt/rsc.scala"   repl-min.scm
      $ ./rsc -t py -l min -c "ksh prebuilt/rsc.sh"        repl-min.scm
      $ gcc -o rsc.exe prebuilt/rsc.c
      $ ./rsc -t py -l min -c ./rsc.exe                    repl-min.scm

    Do the same but generating a JavaScript program:

      $ ./rsc -t js -l min repl-min.scm

    Use Guile instead of Gambit to compile the REPL with type checking to C
    and then compile RVM with gcc:

      $ RSC_SCHEME_INTERPRETER=guile ./rsc -t c -l max-tc repl-max.scm
      $ gcc repl-max.scm.c
      $ echo "(+ 1 (* 2 3))(car 0)" | ./a.out
      > 7
      > *** type error ()
      >

    You can also use RSC_SCHEME_INTERPRETER=kawa to use Kawa Scheme or
    RSC_SCHEME_INTERPRETER="csi -s" to use Chicken Scheme.

    Use the Gambit compiler to compile the AOT compiler and then use it:

      $ gsc -exe -o rsc-gambit.exe rsc.scm
      $ ./rsc -t c -c ./rsc-gambit.exe repl-max.scm

    Use the Chicken compiler to compile the AOT compiler and then use it:

      $ csc -o rsc-chicken.exe -O2 rsc.scm
      $ ./rsc -t c -c ./rsc-chicken.exe repl-max.scm

    Use Ribbit as a pipeline compiler to compile the trivial program
    `(putchar 65) (putchar 10)` to the corresponding compacted RVM code
    (only 23 bytes of code):

      $ echo "(putchar 65) (putchar 10)" | gsi rsc.scm
      );'u?>vR6!(:lkm!':lkv6y

    Use Ribbit as a pipeline compiler to compile the trivial program
    `(putchar 65) (putchar 10)` to compacted RVM code and combine
    it with the Python implementation of the RVM and execute it with python3:

      $ echo "(putchar 65) (putchar 10)" | ./rsc -l empty -t py | python3
      A

    Compile the Ribbit AOT compiler using itself to get a JavaScript
    version of the compiler and use it to compile a program:

      $ ./rsc -t js -l max rsc.scm   # compile rsc.scm to rsc.scm.js
      $ echo '(display "hello!\n")' > h.scm
      $ ./rsc -t py -l max -c "node rsc.scm.js" h.scm # use bootstrapped compiler
      $ python3 h.scm.py
      hello!

    Bootstrap the Ribbit AOT compiler using a POSIX shell (note
    that with ksh this takes over 5 hours on a fast computer and it
    can take substantially more with other POSIX shells):

      $ ./rsc -t sh -l max -o rsc-bootstrap1.sh rsc.scm
      $ ./rsc -t sh -l max -c "ksh rsc-bootstrap1.sh" -o rsc-bootstrap2.sh rsc.scm
      $ echo '(display "hello!\n")' > h.scm
      $ ./rsc -t sh -l max -m -c "ksh rsc-bootstrap2.sh" h.scm
      $ ksh h.scm.sh
      hello!

The makefile in the `src` directory has these make targets:

      $ make check                     # check proper operation for all hosts

      $ HOST=c make check              # check proper operation for specific host

      $ HOST=py PY_HOST_INTERPRETER=pypy make check  # check proper operation for specific host and interpreter

      $ make check-bootstrap           # check that rsc bootstraps

      $ HOST=py make check-bootstrap   # check that rsc bootstraps with specific host

      $ HOST=sh SH_HOST_INTERPRETER=ksh make check-bootstrap # check that rsc bootstraps with specific host and interpreter

      $ make prebuilt                  # creates prebuilt artifacts for all hosts
