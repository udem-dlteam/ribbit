;; Library to compute the time functions take. This library
;; assumes certain primitives to be available:
;;
;;  (%%timer-start)   : Start an internal timer.
;;  (%%timer-end)     : Ends an internal timer.
;;  (%%timer-display) : Display to stdout the time elapsed between
;;                      the call to %%start-timer and %%end-timer.
;;
;; These primitives have been chosen to limit the computations done
;; inside scheme and to allow hosts to easily implement them.

(%%include-once (ribbit "define-macro"))

;; Should be define for each host
